      <p>Some metaphors for the project would be a trophy case and a journal. These concepts are somewhat familiar to online users and can evoke the game based theming of the website and communicate their uses. For example a trophy case could show off completion across several games, and a journal could show the users statistics and tracked progress as well. The theming would be a dark blue with gold accents to evoke the feeling of old consoles.</p>
